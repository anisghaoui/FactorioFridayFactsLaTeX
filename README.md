## Installation
You will need python 3.6+ and pip

```bash
> pip install --upgrade FFFLaTeX
```

## Launching the script

Just as you would launch any other python script after installation:

``` bash
> FFFLaTeX
```

## Output tex file

The tex file for the FFF XXX will be located under a new folder FFFXXX where you used the FFFLaTeX command, as FFFXXX.tex

This lets you directly modify and compile the tex file under its own folder without dealing with multiple outputs

```bash
> FFFLaTeX
....
> 277
....
> ls
....... ./FFF277/
```
